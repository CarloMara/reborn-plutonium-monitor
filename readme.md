**Introduction**

Reborn Plutoniom Monitor is a small project born from the idea of having the possibility to carry a second monitor around. FYI I'm a student and I move around the city a lot. There are other option in the market that could suit my needs, but they are mostly based off USB, which I imagine would be a pain to get working on linux.

The project is based off a 14 inch laptop display that can be easly found on common on-line stores as spare.

*Things done so far*

I've just designed a first test board with all of the connections from the display's flat cable broken out, so it should be a little easier to test whether or not the pinout of the panel is correct.

**Brief Display Info**

The display I have choose it's not very new, but thanks to it's age a datasheet for it is easily repairable.

I've also chosen this display because it's has all the back-lighting control electronic integrated, saving a big hassle.

**Possible Development Path**

I have bought all the components needed to build the test board , but I still need to find some time to etch a pcb, and try it out.

In the future I plan to make a bigger board, maybe with a 4.0 ble chip in order to control the brightness and get the battery status to the host pc.

Of course this means designing a solution to charge the battery, maybe using USB-PD, but right now I don't have any time for that.
